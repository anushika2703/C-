You are given a node del_node of a Singly Linked List where you have to delete a value of the given node from the linked list but you are not given the head of the list.
cpp without driver's code:
class Solution
{
    public:
    //Function to delete a node without any reference to head pointer.
    void deleteNode(Node *del_node)
    {
       // Node *temp = del_node->next;
        del_node -> data = del_node -> next -> data;
        del_node -> next = del_node -> next -> next; 
    }

};
